when you input details onto the space provided they will follow what you input and click add books except the id for there is already a corresponding id that is assign to each book, it will only show its tru worth is when you input the id that is given by the system to the boom in the id textfield and then click the delete button the it will be remove whiether on java or in sql for whatever is added on java will also be added on my sql but if you remove a row in mysql it will not be credited and what you remove will still be visible when you check your books in the library management, if you want to remove a book you need to do it on the library management or you use truncate table on mysql to remove all row.
